    "In this project, we will analyze county-level results of US presidential elections from 2000-2016 and the strength of the correlation of partisan vote share with 2 factors over time. Specifically, for each year, we calculate the strength of population density correlation...and see which factors have strongly (or less strongly) correlated over time. This will help tell if certain variable is a better predictor of a county's vote over time and could even predict patterns in the upcoming 2020 election."
